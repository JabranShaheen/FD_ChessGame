## Test-Driven Development (TDD)
The development of the FD Chess Game followed the principles of Test-Driven Development:

## Tests First Approach

Before writing the implementation, unit tests were created for each class and method. This ensured that the requirements were clearly understood and that the code would be tested from the outset.
Implementation

After the tests were written and failing, the implementation code was written to pass the tests. This ensures that the code meets the required functionality.
Refactoring

The code was then refactored to improve its structure and readability while ensuring that all tests still pass. This iterative process helps maintain code quality and adaptability.

## Future Improvements
- Enhance the game interface for better user interaction.
- Add more features such as different board sizes and difficulty levels.
- Implement a graphical user interface.
